<h3>Problem Statement: <h3>

<u>Consider two strings A = “qpqrr” and B = “pqprqrp”. Let x be the length of the longest common
subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) between A and B and let y be the number of such longest
common subsequence between A and B. 
<br>
Then x + 5y = </u>

Output:

X = Length of longest common subsequence = 4
<br>
Y = Number of such longest common subsequence between A and B = 3

X + 5Y:
<br>
4 + (5*3) = 19
